(b) The annual report shall contain in appropriate detail all of the following: (1) a balance sheet as of the end of the fiscal year, an income statement, and a statement of changes in financial position for the fiscal year; (2) a statement of the place where the names and addresses of the current members are located; and (3) the statement required by Section 9.03 of these Bylaws.

(c) The annual report shall be accompanied by any pertinent report by independent accountants, or, if there is no such report, by the certificate of an authorized officer of the Corporation that the statements were prepared without audit from the books and records of the Corporation.

### Section 9.03. Annual Statement of Transactions and Indemnifications.

In addition to the annual report described in Section 9.02 of these Bylaws, the Corporation shall furnish annually (pursuant to Section 12592 of the California Corporations Code) to its members and Directors a statement of the transactions and indemnifications to interested persons. If the Corporation does not issue an annual report pursuant to Section 9.02 of these Bylaws, such statement shall be mailed or delivered to members within one hundred twenty (120) days after the close of the fiscal year.

## ARTICLE X. INSPECTION RIGHTS

### Section 10.01. Articles and Bylaws.

The corporation shall keep at its principal office in California the original or a copy of its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws as amended to date, which shall be open to inspection by the members at all reasonable times during office hours. If the Corporation has no office in California, it shall furnish on the written request of any member a copy of the Articles or Bylaws as amended to date.

### Section 10.02. Books and Records.

The accounting books and records and minutes of proceedings of the members, the Board of Directors, and committees of the Board shall be open to inspection on the written demand of any member at any reasonable time, for a purpose reasonably related to that person's interests as a member.

Every Director has the absolute right at any reasonable time to inspect and copy all books, records, and documents of every kind, and to inspect the physical properties of the Corporation.

### Section 10.03. Inspection of Membership List.

(a) Subject to the Corporation's right to set aside a member's demand for inspection pursuant to Section 12601 of the California Corporations Code and the power of the court to limit inspection rights pursuant to Section 12602 of the California Corporations Code, and unless the Corporation provides a reasonable alternative pursuant to Section 10.03(c) of these Bylaws, a member may do either or both of the following:

   1. Inspect and copy the record of all the members' names, addresses, and voting rights, at reasonable times, on making a written demand five (5) business days in advance which states the purpose for which the inspection rights are requested;

   2. Obtain from the Secretary, upon written demand and tender of a reasonable charge, a list of names, addresses, and voting rights of those members entitled to vote for the election of Directors, as of the most recent record date for which it has been compiled, or as of a date specified by the member subsequent to the date of demand. The demand shall state the purpose for which the list is requested. The membership list shall be made available on or before the later of ten (10) business days after the demand is received or after the date specified as the date as of which the list is to be compiled.

(b) The rights set forth in Subsection (a) of this Bylaw section may be exercised by any member or members possessing five percent (5%) or more of the voting power for a purpose reasonably related to the members' interest as members. The Corporation may deny access to the membership list where it reasonably believes that the information therein will be used for another purpose or where the Corporation provides a reasonable alternative pursuant to Section 10.03(c) of these Bylaws.

(c) The Corporation may within ten (10) days after receiving a demand, deliver a written offer of an alternative method of achieving the purpose identified in the demand without providing access to or a copy of the membership list. An alternative method that reasonably and in a timely manner accomplishes the proper purpose set forth in a demand made pursuant to Section 10.03(a) of these Bylaws shall be a reasonable alternative, unless the Corporation fails to do the things that it offered to do within a reasonable time after acceptance of the offer. Any rejection of the offer shall be in writing and indicate the reasons the proposed alternative does not meet the proper purpose of the demand.

## ARTICLE XI. SURPLUS ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

### Section 11.01. Fiscal Year.

The fiscal year of the Corporation shall end at the close of the business day on the last day of the month of January of each year.

### Section 11.02. Surplus and Patronage Defined.

(a) "Surplus" shall be defined as the excess of revenues and gains over expenses and losses for a fiscal year. Such surplus shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and shall be computed without regard to any patronage refunds, capital allocations, dividends, or income taxes.

(b) "Patronage" shall be defined as payment of charges for services provided by the Cooperative.

### Section 11.03. Annual Allocations and Distributions of Surplus.

(a) Before any dividends or patronage refunds are distributed for each fiscal year, any surplus should first be allocated to any deficit in the accounting of "retained earnings" of the Corporation.

(b) After any deficit in retained earnings has been eliminated, the Board of Directors may declare a dividend upon shares at a rate not to exceed any maximum rate established by Section 12451 of the California Corporations Code (taking into account any other "distributions" as defined by Section 12235 of the California Corporations Code). No such dividends shall be cumulative.

(c) The Directors may then uniformly distribute all the remaining surplus attributed to patronage of the members of the Corporation to such members as described in the following paragraphs of this subsection of these Bylaws. For the purposes of this subsection of the Bylaws, the remaining patronage surplus shall be computed consistent with Subchapter T of the Internal Revenue Code, related Treasury Regulations, and related court and other relevant interpretations.

   1. Any remaining patronage surplus attributed to the members and to be distributed to them shall be the total remaining patronage surplus attributed to both member and nonmember business (not reduced by dividends on shares but reduced by allocations to eliminate a deficit in retained earnings) multiplied by the ratio of member patronage to total patronage.

   2. A member is entitled to a patronage refund, if such is distributed, in the amount of the remaining patronage surplus, as determined by Paragraph (1) of this subsection of these Bylaws, multiplied by the ratio of such member's patronage with the Corporation to the patronage of all members with the Corporation.

(d) Any dividends declared or patronage refunds paid or allocated pursuant to this section of the Bylaws may be in the form of shares, in whole or in part, subject to Subsections (e) and (f) of this section of these Bylaws.

(e) If a member owns three hundred dollars ($300.00) or more in shares as of the end of the fiscal year for which dividends are declared or patronage refunds are to be paid or allocated, such member shall receive all of her or his dividends and patronage refunds in cash. The three hundred dollar ($300.00) amount shall be known as a member's "Fair Share."

(f) If the cash payment to a member for such member's dividends and patronage refunds together would total less than one dollar ($1.00), the Board of Directors shall distribute such dividends and patronage refunds to the member wholly in shares.

(g) Each person who becomes a member of this Corporation consents to include in his or her gross income for federal income tax purposes the amount of any patronage refund paid to him or her by this Corporation in money or by written notice of allocation (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code), except to the extent that such a patronage refund is not income to the member because (i) it is attributable to the purchase of personal, living, or family items, or (ii) it should properly be treated as an adjustment to the tax basis of property previously purchased. The term "patronage refund," as used herein, shall have the same meaning as the term "patronage dividend," as used in the Internal Revenue Code.

(h) For the purpose of allocating and distributing any annual surplus, the entire operations of the Corporation shall be considered as a unit; provided that by resolution of the Board of Directors, the Corporation may distribute patronage refunds on the basis of the business transacted by each of the departments or divisions into which the operations of the Corporation shall be divided by the Board for the purpose of such allocation.

## ARTICLE XII. BYLAW CHANGES

### Section 12.01. Bylaw Changes by the Board.

The Bylaws shall be adopted, amended, or repealed by the Board of Directors unless the action would:

(a) materially and adversely affect the rights or obligations of members as to voting, dissolution, redemption transfer, distributions, patronage distributions, patronage, property rights, or rights to repayment of contributed capital;

(b) increase or decrease the number of members or shares authorized in total or for any class;

(c) effect an exchange, reclassification, or cancellation of all or part of the memberships or shares;

(d) authorize a new class of memberships or shares;

(f) extend the term of a Director beyond that for which the Director was elected or increase the terms of the Directors;

(g) allow all or any portion of the Directors to hold office by virtue of designation or selection rather than by election by the members: and

(h) allow the Board to fill vacancies occurring in the Board by reason of the removal of Directors.

### Section 12.02. Bylaw Changes by the Members.

Where the Board of Directors is denied the right to adopt, amend, or repeal these Bylaws pursuant to Section 12.01 of these Bylaws, these Bylaws shall be adopted, amended, or repealed by approval of the members.
