Title: Abuse Policy

When IO Cooperative receives an abuse report indicating that a member's IP
address is the origin of abuse, for example a report of attempts to gain
unauthorized access to a system originating from a member's IP address, IO 
Cooperative will notify the member that they have 48 hours to respond to the
report, illustrating how the abuse has been stopped or how the report was 
inaccurate. If the member has not responded or resolved the abuse within that
time their IP address will be blocked from inbound and outbound network access.

If IO Cooperative deems that the reported abuse is affecting service 
availability for other cooperative members, the IP address will be immediately
blocked and the member will be notified of the abuse and the block.

Once the abuse is resolved the member's IP address may be unblocked. IO 
Cooperative will terminate membership of any member who either repeatedly allows
abuse to originate from their IP address or if the IO Cooperative board deems
the abuse to be intentional.
