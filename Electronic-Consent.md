## CONSENT AND NOTICE REGARDING ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS FOR IO COOPERATIVE, INC.

### Electronic delivery of communications

You agree and consent to receive electronically all communications, agreements, documents, notices and disclosures (collectively, "Communications") that we provide in connection with your membership in IO Cooperative, Inc. ("the Cooperative") and your use of our services.

You accept electronic Communications as reasonable and proper notice, for the purpose of any and all laws, rules, and regulations, and agree that such electronic form fully satisfies any requirement that such communications be provided to you in writing or in a form that you may keep.

Communications include:

* agreements and policies you agree to (e.g., the Cooperative's Bylaws and Privacy Policy), including updates to these agreements or policies;
* notices of meetings;
* ballots for member voting;
* annual reports and disclosures;
* transaction receipts or confirmations;
* and any other membership or transaction information.

### Method of delivering electronic Communications to you

All Communications that we provide to you in electronic form will be provided either (1) via email at the primary email address listed in your member profile, or (2) by access to a website that we will designate in an email notice we send to the primary email address listed in your member profile at the time the information is available.

### Hardware and software requirements

In order to access and retain electronic Communications, you will need the following computer hardware and software:

* a computer with an Internet connection;
* a current web browser that includes 128-bit encryption with cookies enabled;
* a software program capable of opening documents in Portable Document Format (PDF);
* a valid email address (your primary email address in your member profile);
* and sufficient storage space to save past Communications or an installed printer to print them.

We will notify you if there are any material changes to the hardware or software needed to receive electronic Communications from the Cooperative. By giving your consent you are confirming that you have access to the necessary equipment and are able to receive, open, and print or download a copy of any Communications for your records. You may print or save a copy of these Communications for your records as they may not be accessible online at a later date.

### How to withdraw your consent

You may withdraw your consent to receive Communications electronically by contacting us via email at [support@iocoop.org][], or by contacting us via the "Contact Us" link on the Cooperative's website. If you fail to provide or if you withdraw your consent to receive Communications electronically, the Cooperative reserves the right to deny your application for membership, restrict your access to services provided by the Cooperative, and/or terminate your membership with the Cooperative.

### Requesting paper copies of electronic Communications

If, after you consent to receive Communications electronically, you would like a paper copy of a Communication we previously sent you, you may request a copy within 60 days of the date we provided the Communication to you by contacting us at [support@iocoop.org][]. We will send your paper copy to you by U.S. mail. In order for us to send you paper copies, you must have a current street address on file in your member profile. If you request paper copies, you understand and agree that the Cooperative may charge you a reasonable fee for the production and mailing of each Communication.

### Updating your contact information

**It is your responsibility to keep your primary email address up to date so that the Cooperative can communicate with you electronically.** You understand and agree that if the Cooperative sends you an electronic Communication but you do not receive it because your primary email address on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic Communications, the Cooperative will be deemed to have provided the Communication to you.

You agree to keep the Cooperative informed of any changes in your email address. You can update your email address or street address at any time by logging into the member section of the Cooperative's website, by submitting an electronic request to [support@iocoop.org][], or by submitting a written request to the Cooperative.


It is recommended that you save or print a copy of this Agreement for future reference.
