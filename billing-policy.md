## Payment Methods

IO Cooperative accepts payment via electronic means only -- For example Google Checkout, Paypal, Credit Card, or ACH transfer. IO Cooperative does not accept payment via paper means. (No cash, nor cheques.)

## Billing Cycle

All services except hosting usage overage fees are pre-paid. Usage overage fees are billed monthly, and must be paid within 30 calendar days of being billed.

## Invoicing

We issue invoices and receipts via e-mail. This helps us keep our costs low, which in turn helps us to keep our prices down. Payment must be made for at least one month of service and, if applicable, any installation fees prior to initial service activation. You will receive a payment confirmation via e-mail when your payment is processed.

## Service Suspension

Unless alternative arrangements have been made to IO Cooperative's satisfaction, customers with balances 30 calendar days past due or greater are considered delinquent and subject to immediate service disconnection. IO Cooperative will not provide delinquent accounts with access to any customer-owned equipment nor to any data stored on its servers. We will notify the primary account contacts of pending suspension before suspending services.

## Service Cancellation

In order to cancel service with IO Cooperative, members must request cancellation in writing via email to [support@iocoop.org][].

   [support@iocoop.org]: mailto:support@iocoop.org

Only the primary account holder can cancel an account. If you host data on our servers, be sure to retrieve any information you want to keep -- e-mail, web pages, files in your web site, home directories, etc. before you cancel. Upon cancellation, all user data will become inaccessible. As a matter of policy, we scrub the disk image associated with your VPS.

You will be responsible for all service fees through the effective date of cancellation regardless of whether or not you used the service. Cancellation requests must be made 30 days prior to the last day of service. For example, to terminate service on May 15th, a member would need to notify IO Cooperative by email on April 14th or before. If, in cancelling service, the member no longer is being provided any services from IO Cooperative, they may also leave the co-operative and be refunded their member deposit. This should be requested along with the service cancellation.

## Refund Policy

IO Cooperative will refund the prorated amount remaining on the member's contract starting at the beginning of the first calendar month after cancellation. For example, if a member notifies IO Cooperative on April 28th that they wish to terminate service as of May 31st, and they pay quarterly, the member would receive a refund for the month of June (1/3rd of the quarterly payment for April, May and June).

## Collection

Delinquent accounts may be turned over to a collection agency, in which case the account holder will be responsible for all collection costs, including reasonable attorney fees.
